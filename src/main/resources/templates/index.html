    <p>Hello, welcome to the Midas trading! Currently, this website is a small cut-my-teeth project. Once you create a
    user and sign in, you will be able to search stock data details, and perform a backtrade test on your favorite 5 stocks.
    Only 5 stocks are available currently... You can also optimize a trade by using the optimize function. You enter ranges
    for metrics like ema and sma then our lovely servers will figure out the best metric combinations for your convenience.
    Just be patient as the "lovely" servers aren't always fast</p>
    <p>I plan to build up this application to handle active trading, and provide more data on backtrades like a graph for
    profit grows over time for the winning trade! I also plan on putting this application on my kubernetes cluster and
    building a microservice that is able to disperse orders over multiple pods.</p>
    <p>Overall, this is my little project that helps me better develop my skills with a chance of actually it actually
    financially helping me in the future.</p>
